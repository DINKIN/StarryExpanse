During the cleanup process, several actors were reparented to use DummyActor, allowing the ability to remove several other references.
I could've just used the base Actor class, but this helped to disambiguate what was already a standard Actor vs what was changed in the project.
The idea behind doing it this way was to keep have placed objects (particularly in /O) keep their current transforms within the level.
Now that cleanup has been finished, the only remaining task is to remove DummyActor (and the corresponding DELETE_ME folder).
But unfortunately, removing the DummyActor reference would require the removal of a few other placed objects.
And for whatever reason, one of those references appears to be very difficult to remove without using "force delete", which is bad news.
So for the time being, this folder stays put until it is safe to get rid of.
